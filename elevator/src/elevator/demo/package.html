Contains the primary class of the AminationDemo application which illustrates a
way of controlling the <code>elevator.Elevators</code> application via Java RMI.
The application submits a sequence
of control commands separated with a 2-3 sec time delay to the components of
<a href="../Elevators.html">elevator.Elevators</a> application (motors, doors and scales)
via java RMI which forces the elevators to open/close doors, to move upwards/downwards.
The object with the <code>AminationDemo</code> class uses static methods of
the <code>elevator.rmi.MakeAll</code> class to get remote
references to the components of elevators and to control the components.
<p>To run the application, first, start rmiregistry, then Elevators and, finally,
AnimationDemo. It's recommended to start Elevators and AnimationDemo in different
windows so that you can keep Elevators running when you restart the demo
or when you start your own control/animation program.
To see result of AnimationDemo, you should look at Elevators.
<p>For example (assume that the Elevators is located under "D:\home\vlad\edu\elevator\"),
<p><blockquote><pre>
C:\>start rmiregistry
C:\>java -classpath D:\home\vlad\edu\elevator\lib\elevator.jar -Djava.security.policy=D:\home\vlad\edu\elevator\lib\rmi.policy -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:d:\home\vlad\edu\elevator\lib\elevator.jar elevator.Elevators -top 5 -number 5 -rmi
C:\>java -classpath D:\home\vlad\edu\elevator\lib\elevator.jar elevator.demo.AnimationDemo
</pre></blockquote>
Where <code>rmi.security</code> is a text file that should specify the following permission:
<p><blockquote><pre>
grant {
// Allow everything for now
permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
</pre></blockquote>
The <code>elevator.jar</code> file is a JAR file that includes all resources
of the Elevators application including classes and interfaces needed to
develop a control program with Java RMI.
