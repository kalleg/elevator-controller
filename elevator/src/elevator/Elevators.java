/**
 * The primary class of the Elevators application written in Java that simulates
 * elevators (motors, doors, scales, inside button panels and floor buttons).
 * <p>The application is constructed with the MVC (Model-View-Controller)
 * architecture. According to the FOLDOC dictionary, MVC is a way of partitioning
 * the design of interactive software. The "Model" is the internal workings of the program
 * (e.g., state of motors, doors, scales and buttons), the "View" is
 * how the user sees the state of the model (Elevators GUI, I/O and RMI),
 * and the "Controller" is how the user changes the state or provides input.
 * <p>The application provide the "View" and the "Model" parts. The "controller"
 * part can be connected to the application via standard input/output, TCP sockets
 * or/and Java RMI.
 * <p>The application performs an animation of elevators at a predefined rate
 * set to the application Timer which starts after the application GUI ("view") is created.
 * The Timer clocks the animation. On each time step, the "view" part of the
 * application inspects a state of the "model" part (elevator positions, direction
 * of movement, door sates, value of scales) and displays a new state if the state
 * of the model has changed since the previous time step.
 * <p>The "controller" part is not provided except of some input to the controller:
 * action events from floor and inside buttons and current positions of elevators.
 * The controller can get the input from the standard output of Elevators, a TCP socket
 * output stream or/and via Java RMI (remote call backs).
 * The elevators can be controlled via standard input, socket connections and/or Java RMI
 * (controlling stubs).
 * <p>When the user presses buttons, a controller receives action commands (action
 * events) from the buttons via controller's input stream or/and via RMI (call
 * backs). The controller should react on button pressings according to some control
 * algorithm, i.e. it should get and analyze current positions of elevators,
 * make decisions to start/stop motors, to open/close doors, to set values to
 * elevator scales, to start monitoring positions of elevators. Current positions of moving
 * elevator(s) are provided to the controller with a predefined rate of
 * the application Timer to the output stream (standard or socket)
 * of the application. To monitor current positions of elevator(s) via Java RMI,
 * the controller must register (add) a position listener(s) to a motor, all motors
 * or a group of motors. The listener gets a sequence of position values
 * with the rate of the Timer if the position is changing over the time.
 * The rate of the Timer is controlled "by-hand" with a special gauge of the application GUI.
 * <p>The controller can control the elevators (motors, doors and scales) by sending
 * control commands to the input stream (standard or socket) of Elevators or
 * by calling remote methods on Elevators via RMI stubs which can be obtained by
 * static methods of the MakeAll class.
 * <p>When starts, the application accepts the following options specified with
 * or without values:
 * <p>
 * <center><table border="1">
 * <tr><td><code>-number int</code><td>The number of elevators</tr>
 * <tr><td><code>-top int</code><td>The number of the top floor.

 *                                    the application prints a string "f <i>n p</i>",
 *                                    where "f" stands for "floor units",
 *                                    <i>n</i> is the elevator number and <i>p</i> is a
 *                                    float position value in "floor units"
 *                                    (e.g. "f 2 2.5" means that the 2nd elevator
 *                                    is exactly in between the 2nd and the 3rd floors.</tr>
 * <tr><td><code> v <td>Get the current velocity of elevators.<br>In response,

 *                                    <i>value</i> is the double value of the
 *                                    elevators' velocity in "floor units"
 *                                    per millisecond.</tr>
 * </table> </center>
 * <p>
 * When an inside panel button or a floor button is pressed the application prints
 * an action command associated with the button to the standard output and to
 * a TCP socket output stream, if the application has started with the <code>-tcp</code>
 * option. When controlling the application via Java RMI, use static methods
 * of the <code>elevator.rmi.MakeAll</code> class for adding <code>ActionListener</code>
 * objects in order to receive and to react on action events from the buttons
 * of elevators.
 * <p>An action command associated with an inside panel button printed to the standard
 * output or a TCP socket is "p <i>n f</i>" (where "p"
 * stands for "panel", <i>n</i> is the number of the elevator where the button
 * is located and <i>f</i> is a floor number assigned to the button.
 * <p>An action command associated with a floor button and printed to the standard
 * output or a TCP socket is "b <i>n d</i>" (where "b"
 * stands for "button", <i>n</i> is the number of the floor where the button
 * is located and <i>d</i> is a direction (up or down) associated with the button.
 * <p>As default (if the "-nopos" command line option is not specified),
 * the application prints to the
 * standard output or a TCP socket the position of an elevator when it moves. The
 * new position is printed at a predefined rate set for the internal Timer object of the
 * elevators. You can change the rate of the Timer (i.e. velocity of the elevators)
 * with a control velocity slider
 * of the Elevators GUI. The position is printed in "floor" units.
 * An RMI-based controller can add a position listener with the <code>ActionListener</code>
 * interface to the elevators time to monitor positions of moving elevators. The
 * listener will be notified with an action event when the position has changed.
 * An action command that comes in the event object contains position(s) of
 * elevator(s) in the same format ("f elevator position") as it's printed to the standard
 * output or a TCP socket connection. The RMI-based controller can add also a velocity
 * listener that will be notified with an action event when the velocity has been changed
 * by the velocity slider. An action command that comes with the action event is
 * "v value".
 * <p>The <a href="package-summary.html">elevator</a> package provides classes
 * and interfaces for the Elevators application.
 * The <a href="rmi/package-summary.html">elevator.rmi</a> package provides classes
 * and interfaces for controlling the Elevators via Java RMI.
 * The <a href="rmi/impl/package-summary.html">elevator.rmi.impl</a> package contains proxy classes
 * that implement remote interfaces of the <code>elevator.rmi</code> package for
 * controlling Elevators via Java RMI.
 * The <a href="demo/package-summary.html">elevator.demo</a> package
 * contains a primary class of the AnimationDemo application that illustrates
 * controlling the Elevators application via Java RMI.
 * <p>The static methods of the <code>elevator.rmi.MakeAll</code> class allow
 * obtaining remote references to different components of elevators (motors,
 * doors and scales), and adding listeners with the <code>ActionListener</code>
 * interface to buttons of elevators. See documentation on the
 * <code>elevator.rmi.MakeAll</code> class for details.
 * <p>To run the Elevators application, first, start rmiregistry and then Elevators.
 * When starting Elevators, you must indicate a path to <code>elevator.jar</code>
 * with the <code>-classpath</code> option.
 * The JAR file is located under the <code>lib</code> directory of the Elevators home.
 * When starting Elevators, you should also specify the <code>-Djava.security.policy</code>
 * property that should be set to the <code>rmi.policy</code> file located
 * under the <code>lib</code> directory and the <code>-Djava.rmi.server.codebase</code>
 * property that should point to the <code>elevator.jar</code> file.
 * For example (assume that the Elevators is located under "D:\home\vlad\edu\elevator\"),
 * <p><blockquote><pre>
 * C:\>start rmiregistry
 * C:\>java -classpath D:\home\vlad\edu\elevator\lib\elevator.jar -Djava.security.policy=D:\home\vlad\edu\elevator\lib\rmi.policy
-Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:d:\home\vlad\edu\elevator\lib\elevator.jar elevator.Elevators -top 5 -number 5 -rmi
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * The <code>rmi.security</code> file is a text file that may specify the following permission:
 * <p><blockquote><pre>
 * grant {
 * // Allow everything for now
 * permission java.security.AllPermission;
 * };
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * The <code>elevator.jar</code> file is a JAR file that includes all resources
 * of the Elevators application including classes and interfaces needed to
 * develop a control program with Java RMI.
