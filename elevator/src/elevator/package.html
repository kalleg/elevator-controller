Provides classes and interfaces for the Elevators application which models the hardware
of elevators (motors, cabins, doors, scale, inside and floor buttons). The primary class
of the application is <a href="Elevators.html">Elevators</a>. The application
is structured in the MVC (Model-View-Cotroller) way, though the Elevators
provides only a Model and a View components. A controller program can be connected
to the Elevators via standard input/output, TCP sock connections or Java RMI.
<p>The Model part of elevators represented by the <a href="Elevator.html">Elevator</a> class
which holds and maintains state of motors, doors and scales of elevators.
<p>The View part of elevators constructed of the following classes which
display the elevators and output their states on the standard
output, a TCP socket or via Java RMI:
<ul>
<li><a href="ElevatorGUI.html">ElevatorGUI</a>
    - An object with this class is created for building
    the graphical widgets of the application, for displaying elevators and buttons.
<li><a href="ElevatorGraphics.html">ElevatorGraphics</a>
    - An object with this class animates moving elevators.
    The animation is timed by the application timer created by the
    <code>ElevatorGUI</code> object.
<li><a href="ElevatorIO.html">ElevatorIO</a>
    - An object of this class is responsible for input/output of the elevator
      state, i.e. the Model, via standard input/output, TCP sockets and Java RMI
      In the last case, the object servers as an interface between the Model,
      i.e. <a href="Elevator.html">Elevator</a> objects, and the
      <code>elevator.rmi.MakeAll</code> class which allows controlling of
      elevators via Java RMI.
<li>classes and interfaces of the
<a href="rmi/package-summary.html">elevator.rmi</a>
and <a href="rmi/impl/package-summary.html">elevator.rmi.impl</a>
packages that are used to control elevators via Java RMI.
</ul>
As the Controller part is actually missing, the application provides a way to
connect a Controller program via standard input, TCP sockets or via Java RMI.
Thus, the Elevators is controlled via GUI (inside and floor buttons, time speed slider),
and by commands sent to the application via standard input, a TCP socket connection
or Java RMI.
See <a href="../doc/elevator/Elevators.html">Elevators</a> for more
details about the Elevators application.
